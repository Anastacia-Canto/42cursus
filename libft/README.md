# LIBFT

It was the first project on the common core. The objective is recreate some important functions from C library creating 
our own library that would be used in the next projects. The functions include string manipulation, type verification and conversion, memory allocation 
and linked list management. 

I used the Linux manuals to discover the description, parameters and returns of each function. To do this we should only 
type, for example, ``` man strlen; ``` on the terminal to have access to strlen manual. 

Several tests were used to make sure the funcionts works as expected and all the possible edge cases were covered. 
At the end of this project we have our package of tools to use in the next projects.
